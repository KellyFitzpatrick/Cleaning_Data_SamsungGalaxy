The code book will walk you through the process of how I went from the origianl data files to the finalized product of tidy data.

All three main objectives of tidy data analysis were met.
1) Each variable forms a column
2) Each observation forms a row
3) Each type of observational unit forms a table

Additiona reading can be found at:http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf

Process of the code:
1. The inital stage lets the user set the working directory
2. The libraries are loaded that R will need

3a. The general information files are uploaded.
3b. The first file is the activity_labels.txt file containg all codes and names 1 to 6 
3c. The second file is the features.txt file that contains all the measurements 1 to 561

4a. The training files are uploaded and new column names are added 
4b. To get the participants ids test/subject_test.txt is loaded
4c. To get the participants activity test/y_test.txt is loaded
4d. To get the participants data results test/X_test.txt is loaded

5a. The test files are uploaded and new column names are added 
5b. To get the participants ids train/subject_test.txt is loaded
5c. To get the participants activity train/y_test.txt is loaded
5d. To get the participants data results train/X_test.txt is loaded

6a. The mean and std columns are selected for review (86 results)
6b. The column names are edited to comply with the rules

7. The three final data tables are merged for the training data the final dataset is called TRAIN2
8. The three final data tables are merged for the test data the final dataset is called TEST2

9. The Final_Merge dataset combines the test and training data using the rbind function in R
    The Final_Merge dataset has 10,299 rows and 89 columns
    The columns start with the x,id,activity, 86 measrements
    The rows are 7,352 from the train dataset and 2,947 from the test dataset
    
    All commands relating to the test data are labeled test_
    All commands relating to the train data are labeled train_
    There are also alot of notations/comments in the R code to clearify the steps in the code.

The Final Output Variable Descriptions

There are 4 columns in the final output and 15,480 rows

Column 1 is the "id"
 The test group has id's 2,4,9,10,12,13,18,20,24  for a total of 9 people
 The training group has id's 1,3,5,6,7,8,11,14,15,16,17,19,21,22,23,25,26,27,28,29,30 for a total of 21 people
 
Column 2 is the "activity"
    There were 6 activities
    
Column 3 is the Feature or "measurement"
    There were 561 total measurements in the study of those 86 were selected that contained the word "mean" or "std"
    The 86 features/measurements selected are:
    
Column 4 is the mean value of that measurement for each id and each activity labeled "value"
   for more information on these values read the README file and the features_info files.
